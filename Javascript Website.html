                                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language Inside a host environment
                                    (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                                </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                <p class="main_points">
                                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, 
                                    control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; 
                                    for example:
                                </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                    <ul class="bullet_points">
                                        <li>
                                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, 
                                            client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and 
                                            page navigation
                                        </li>
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                        <li>
                                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side 
                                            extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application,
                                             or perform file manipulations on a server.

                                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The 
                                    JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
                                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs 
                                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

                                            <br>
                                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime 
                                    system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript 
                                    has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based 
                                    model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript 
                                    also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, 
                                    executing as loosely typed methods.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, 
                                    and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you 
                                    do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed

                                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, 
                                    so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                                </p>
                                    <p class="main_points">
                                        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window
                                        or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example,if a variable called phoneNumber is declared 
                                        in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

                                                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional 
                                                else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

                                            It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when 
                                            glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code

                                                        <li>

                                                              }

                                                    If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment.
